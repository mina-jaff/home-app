Home App
The Home App is a platform for a company that rents to a selected group of tenants.
To register with Home and start booking apartments, users need to fill in a multi-page application form.
This project is a proposal for the general design and layout of the platform and the multi-page application form.
Due to the scope of the project, there is no database connection, and therefore, user data will not be submitted.
